# Beautiful_Boxes
Python Script Generates Boxs Recursively 

Pulled from a seperate project and turned to "art" efforts.
Splits boxes recursively with some added randomness, colors, and different constrainst on the number of splits. 

Also returns a node list of the splits. My other project uses these nodes as a building block 
for synthetic circuit diagram images.
